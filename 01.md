#### **Question 1: Spring Architecture**

**What was the primary motivation behind Spring's shift from XML-based configuration to Java-based configuration?**

1. To eliminate the need for dependency injection
2. To improve type safety and leverage IDE tooling
3. To reduce startup time by avoiding reflection
4. To simplify integration with legacy systems

---

#### **Question 2: Core Container Modules**

**Which Spring module is responsible for managing bean lifecycles and dependency resolution?**

1. `spring-core`
2. `spring-beans`
3. `spring-context`
4. `spring-expression`

---

#### **Question 3: Java Configuration**

**Given the configuration below, what happens when `@ComponentScan` is used without arguments?**

```java  
@Configuration  
@ComponentScan  
public class AppConfig {}  
```

1. Scans all packages under the class's package
2. Scans only classes annotated with `@Bean`
3. Disables component scanning entirely
4. Scans the `org.springframework.stereotype` package

---

#### **Question 4: Bean Conflicts**

**How does Spring resolve conflicts when two beans of the same type are declared in separate `@Configuration` classes?**

1. Throws a `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`
2. Uses the bean from the configuration class loaded first
3. Prioritizes the bean with `@Primary`
4. Merges the bean definitions

---

#### **Question 5: Dependency Injection**

**Which injection method is recommended for mandatory dependencies in Spring?**

1. Setter injection
2. Field injection with `@Autowired`
3. Constructor injection
4. Method injection via `@Bean`

---

#### **Question 6: Circular Dependencies**

**How does Spring handle circular dependencies when using constructor injection?**

1. Automatically resolves them via proxy objects
2. Throws a `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException`
3. Uses lazy initialization by default
4. Ignores the circular reference

---

#### **Question 7: @Qualifier vs @Primary**

**When should `@Qualifier` be used instead of `@Primary`?**

1. To prioritize a bean for autowiring
2. To resolve ambiguity between multiple beans of the same type
3. To enable lazy initialization
4. To mark a bean as optional

---

#### **Question 8: Conditional Bean Registration**

**Which annotation enables bean registration only if a specific property is set in `application.properties`?**

1. `@ConditionalOnProperty`
2. `@Profile`
3. `@DependsOn`
4. `@Lazy`

---

#### **Question 9: Bean Scope**

**What is the default scope of a bean declared with `@Bean` in a `@Configuration` class?**

1. Prototype
2. Request
3. Singleton
4. Session


---

#### **Question 10: Expression Language**

**Which SpEL expression injects a system property into a field?**

```java  
@Value("___")  
private String javaVersion;  
```

1. `#{systemProperties['java.version']}`
2. `${java.version}`
3. `@systemProperties['java.version']`
4. `&amp;{java.version}`
